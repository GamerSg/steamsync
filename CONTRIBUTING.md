Not much to say. We live dangerously so we don't have tests or anything ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

We format the code with `black`.

```console
black -l 110 steamsync.py
```

Other than that, you probably can't make it any worse structure wise, so send a 
PR!

Eventually it would be nice to add other launchers, maybe?
